HCI Project - History of Informatics v2.0
==============
This repo contains all the material for the HCI Project. It is organised to comply with `Flask` conventions (main file and templates). In order to deploy the server, see below.

Deploy
--------------
Before you begin, make sure that you have all of the required packages installed, see below for details.

In order to run the program, cd to the HCI_Project/FlaskApp folder, and run main.py using 

    python3 main.py

This will start the server and allow you to visit the page at the address [127.0.0.1:5000](127.0.0.1:5000)

Requirements
--------------
The program was designed to run on Python 3.4.1, so that is needed. In order to run properly, you also need the following modules:


| Module           | Command to install          |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Flask            | pip3 install Flask          |
